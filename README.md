The Card-Players' Algorithm
=====================

The Card-Players' Algorithm, developed by Akash Nag in 2017, is a fast heuristic algorithm for solving high-density variants of the subset-sum problem, which is a NP-complete problem. This repository provides a Java implementation for this algorithm.
